# freelancer_sdk_v2
Improved version of freelancer-sdk package, few bug fixes, and a get_reviews() function

This is largely a fork of the original SDK:

https://github.com/freelancer/freelancer-sdk-python

I just fixed a few bugs with the get_bids() method, and added a method for parsing reviews from projects.
